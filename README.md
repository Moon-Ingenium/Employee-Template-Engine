# Employee-Template-Engine
*   First I created the Employee class in a js file
*    Then I created another js file to extend the classes Engineer, Intern, and Manager
*   Then I useing  htmlRenderer.js I wrote the code to create app.js
*   I had to create a folder for the new file to write to
*   Then I made sure all the tests worked
